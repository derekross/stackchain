ABSTRACT

Plebs may want to attach another purchase to their or others' orphaned stacks, or pool together funds to produce a stack.

PROCESS

To start a Stackjoin (pooled):
	1) Visit the @AriZonanHODL Stackchain thread located at 'https://twitter.com/AriZonanHODL/status/1549169119924080640', or the NEWSTACK of your choice.
	2) Find the current Stack Height of the Stackchain. (i.e. $200 USD)
	3) Reply with your intentions to start pooling, and attach an image of your Bitcoin purchase as your initial contribution.
	4) Wait until the amount contributed is equal to the latest tip height. The threshold adjusts with the tip height.
	5) Follow the steps on how to publish a Stackjoin

To contribute to a Stackjoin:
	1) Make sure your contribution would not bring the pool above the current height.
	2) Make the purchase of your contribution amount.
	3) Reply to the Stackjoin proposal with the image of your purchase (orphaned stacks can be included).

How to publish a Stackjoin:
	1a) (pooled) Collect all contributions.
    1b) (unpooled) Link to all original posts. This is required to prevent double spends.
	2) Publish a reply to the tip of the current stackchain (the original Stackchain or a NEWSTACK) with all pictures of purchases.
