SIP: 0006
LAYER: Consensus
TITLE: MANDATORY PROOF IN BLOCKS
AUTHOR: Semisol (twitter.com/semisol_public)
STATUS: Draft
TYPE: Standards Track
CREATED: 2022-09-09

ABSTRACT

This SIP mandates that blocks contain proof of purchase in the block post and not in replies.

RESTRICTIONS ADDED

All blocks MUST have proof in the main Tweet of the block, which is the first reply announcing a block.
If all screenshots cannot fit, proofs may be:
- Split across multiple replies, forming a thread of proofs.
- Converted into one large image
- Converted into a video or GIF

Stackjoin block miners SHOULD post a link to all Ttweets as a reply to their SJ.
The root tweet MUST NOT contain any images or non-proof media unless all proofs fit in the root tweet.
